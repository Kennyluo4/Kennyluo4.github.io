**the miRNAs involved in symbiosis**

_**miR160**_ :plays a crucial role in maintaining the auxin/cytokinin balance during soybean nodule inception and maturation.

(Nizampatnam et al., 2015)

_**miR167**_ : acts upstreamofNIN,NSP1,NF-YA1,NF-YA2,andENOD40andpositively regulates nodule formation by inhibiting GmARF8a and GmARF8b expression (Auxin-mediated organogenesis)

(Wang et al., 2015).
