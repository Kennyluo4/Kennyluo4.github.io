**The interaction with soild bacteria is not only limited to plant roots. Foliar immunity system is also involved. Compond synthesized in leaves is transport to root
*Glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) is a well-known mobile regulator of systemic acquired resistance (SAR)
*G3P is needed for stran-scpecific exlcusion of non-desirable bacteria, and is associated with foliar pathogen imunity.
