_**Leaf imunity is also activated in response to root interaction with incompatible nitrogen fixing bacteria**_

>The interaction with soild bacteria is not only limited to plant roots. Foliar immunity system is also involved. Compond synthesized in leaves is transport to root

>Glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) is a well-known mobile regulator of systemic acquired resistance (SAR)

>G3P is needed for stran-scpecific exlcusion of non-desirable bacteria, and is associated with foliar pathogen imunity.

**_Nod genes is not necessary for legume symbiosis in some rhizobia_**

>In two symbiotic, photosynthetic, Bradyrhizobium strains, BTAi1 and ORS278, canonical nodABC genes and typical lipochitooligosaccharidic Nod factors are not required for symbiosis in some legumes.

>There is a possible alternative pathway, where a purine derivative may play a key role in triggering nodule formation

**__Is Nod Factors also required in intercellular invasion (including crack entry) symbiosis?__**

>In A. indica and A. sensitiva NFs are neither required for invasion of the roots nor for nodule primordia formation (Giraud et al., 2007).

>bradyrhizobia can nodulate Aeschynomene plants in two ways: one that depends on a functional T3SS and other NFs, and T3SS independent, which relies on a still unknown mechanism.(Okazaki et al., 2015)

>Sesbania rostrata, intercellular invasion of the roots depends on NFs to induce cell death for infection pocket formation (Capoen et al., 2010). 
> The colonization of the outer cortex depends on NFs but would be independent of calcium spiking. 
>There is a less stringent requirement for NF structures for inducing and infecting the nodule primordia.

>NFs are not necessary for invasion of Arachis hypogaea roots (Ibañez and Fabra, 2011).


>peanut nodulation can also be achieved by rhizobia lacking nod genes, but the nodulation seems to be vestigial and non-significant in natural conditions.

>Whether NF-independent nodulation of peanut depends on a functional rhizobial T3SS is still not known. And those determinants (‘entry key’) allowing NF-independent nodulation have not been identified.

* These results indicate that peanut have have NF-dependent and -independent systems. 
>In the NF- dependent program, these bacterial molecules are required for initiating the cellular divisions for nodule primordia development

* For NF dependent system, there are two possible models for NF preception:
>1. NFs are required for intracellular infection of the basal cortical cell that forms the nodule primordia
>2. rhizobia can become intracellular without NFs but that these NFs are required in order to reinitiate meristematic activity of the infected cell.

> NFR genes (NFR1 NFR5) in peanut have been identified (Ibáñez et al., 2015). But their epidermic or cortial localization has not been determined. 

* In our study, the NFR5 CRISPR knock out lead to non-nodulating phenotype (but not for NFR1), suggesting the NFR may play a lead function.

>an appropriate bacterial cell surface (rhizobial exopolysaccharides, EPS) is important for peanut intercellular infection.
