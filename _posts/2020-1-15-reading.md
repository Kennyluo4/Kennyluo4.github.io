**Leaf imunity is also activated in response to root interaction with incompatible nitrogen fixing bacteria**

The interaction with soild bacteria is not only limited to plant roots. Foliar immunity system is also involved. Compond synthesized in leaves is transport to root

Glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) is a well-known mobile regulator of systemic acquired resistance (SAR)

G3P is needed for stran-scpecific exlcusion of non-desirable bacteria, and is associated with foliar pathogen imunity.

__**Nod genes is not necessary for legume symbiosis in some rhizobia**__

In two symbiotic, photosynthetic, Bradyrhizobium strains, BTAi1 and ORS278, canonical nodABC genes and typical lipochitooligosaccharidic Nod factors are not required for symbiosis in some legumes.

There is a possible alternative pathway, where a purine derivative may play a key role in triggering nodule formation
